          Answer questions before your home visit

        <p>
          To help prepare for your home visit, you can answer the questions in this section. This step is optional, however your fostering journey can be made simpler by telling us more about yourself. The questions will give you an idea of the conversation that you’ll have during your home visit and the social worker will be able to see your answers beforehand.

          The social worker will come to your home to find out more about you and your reasons for wanting to become a foster carer. If you’ve answered the questions in the previous section, you’ll talk more about them. The home visit stage can be completed in one session but it may require more sessions to make sure that the social worker has all of the information that they need.
