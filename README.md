## Philosophy
To enable citizens to engage with the fostering journey eariler and provide the Council with valuable information these forms have been developed to gather informationduring the whole fostering journey.

This will have the dual benefit of engaging with the users more easily and allowing back office staff access to their details eariler in the process.

The application has been spilt into two defining sections:
- Task list
- Mini forms

### Task list
The task list section defines what the user will be completing during the fostering process. It splits the page into sections and adds tags to let the user know what stage they currently are at.

### Mini forms
In order to collec the data more easily we have developed quick and easy to complete forms for users. These forms allow the user to save often and update their information at any point.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```
